# Position Persistence Fix - Complete

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

**Problem**: Character cards weren't saving positions
**Root Cause**: Campaign had 0 real characters, so system generated sample characters with IDs `sample-1`, `sample-2`, `sample-3` that don't exist in database.

When dragging sample characters → 404 errors trying to save positions.

## ✅ Fixes Applied

### 1. **Skip Saving for Sample Characters**
- File: `campaign/[id]/page.tsx:131-134`
- Now detects sample IDs and skips database save
- Sample cards can still be dragged (positions just won't persist)

### 2. **Proper Sample Character Structure**
- File: `characterManager.ts:196-229`
- Sample characters now include `id` field in character data
- Ensures ID extraction works correctly

### 3. **All Previous Fixes Still Active**
- ✅ Zoom warping fix (captured scale)
- ✅ Position loading from `json.position.{x,y}`
- ✅ Debounced saves (500ms)
- ✅ Proper callback chain

## 🧪 Testing Guide

### Test 1: Sample Characters (Empty Campaign)
**Setup**: Campaign with 0 real characters
**Expected**:
- Should see 3 sample characters: Zara, Marcus, Luna
- Can drag them around
- Console shows: `⚠️ Skipping save for sample character: sample-X`
- After refresh: Positions reset (normal for samples)

### Test 2: Real Characters
**Setup**: Campaign with actual characters from database
**Steps**:
1. Add a character via Relations tab
2. Drag the character card
3. Wait 500ms
4. Check console: Should see `✅ Character clxxx position saved successfully`
5. Refresh page
6. Character should be in same position

**Expected Console Output**:
```
🎯 Node clxxx position updated to absolute world coordinates: (500, 300)
🎯 Saving character clxxx position to (500, 300)
✅ Character clxxx position saved successfully
```

**After Reload**:
```
🎯 Position extraction for clxxx : { position object: { x: 500, y: 300 }, final x: 500, final y: 300 }
```

### Test 3: Mixed (Samples + Real)
**Setup**: Campaign with both sample and real characters
**Expected**:
- Sample characters: Drag works, no save, positions reset on refresh
- Real characters: Drag works, saves to DB, positions persist on refresh

## 🐛 Debugging

### If Sample Characters Show:
**Reason**: No real characters in campaign
**Solution**: Add characters via Relations tab "Add Character" button

### If Real Characters Not Saving:
1. Check browser console for save confirmation
2. Check Network tab for `PATCH /api/characters/[id]/position`
3. Response should be `200 OK` with `{"success": true}`
4. Check Prisma Studio → Character table → json field → should have `position: {x, y}`

### If Positions Still Reset:
1. Verify character ID doesn't start with `sample-` or `char-fallback-`
2. Check that `char.character.id` in logs matches database ID
3. Verify position is being loaded: Look for "Position extraction" log with correct x/y

## 📊 Expected Behavior Matrix

| Character Type | Can Drag | Saves to DB | Persists After Reload |
|---|---|---|---|
| Sample (`sample-X`) | ✅ Yes | ❌ No (skipped) | ❌ No |
| Real (from DB) | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes (debounced) | ✅ Yes |
| Fallback (`char-fallback-X`) | ✅ Yes | ❌ No (skipped) | ❌ No |

## 🎯 Next Steps

If you want positions to persist for sample characters too:
1. Store sample positions in localStorage
2. Load from localStorage on mount
3. Update `handleCharacterPositionChange` to handle localStorage for samples

But for now, sample characters are intentionally non-persistent since they're just for UI preview.
