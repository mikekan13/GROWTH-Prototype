## **CRITICAL: Live Campaign Development Approach (Updated 2025-09-14)**

### **ðŸŽ¯ Development Philosophy: Build-As-We-Play**
**This prototype is being developed in parallel with an ACTIVE live campaign.** This fundamentally changes our development approach:

#### **Priority System:**
1. **ðŸ”¥ URGENT**: Features needed for immediate live campaign use
2. **âš¡ HIGH**: Features that improve live campaign experience
3. **ðŸ“‹ NORMAL**: General improvements and polish
4. **ðŸš€ FUTURE**: Long-term enhancements

#### **Key Principles:**
- **Flexibility First**: All features must be rapidly modifiable for live campaign needs
- **Google Sheets Fallback**: Sheets serve as development workspace AND emergency fallback
- **Database â†’ Sheets Flow**: Data flows FROM database TO Google Sheets (not vice versa)
- **Rapid Iteration**: Quick fixes and modifications are critical for live play
- **No Breaking Changes**: Live campaign cannot be disrupted by bugs

#### **Development Workflow:**
1. **Template Development**: User perfects aesthetics/fields in Google Sheets template
2. **Mirror Interface**: Claude builds matching database-driven interface
3. **Live Testing**: Features tested during actual campaign sessions
4. **Rapid Fixes**: Bugs fixed immediately to prevent campaign disruption
5. **Gradual Migration**: Eventually remove Google Sheets when mirror is perfect

#### **Character Sheet Strategy:**
- **Current**: Google Sheets = primary, Database mirror = secondary
- **Goal**: Database mirror = primary, Google Sheets = deprecated
- **Transition**: Gradual shift as mirror interface improves
- **Fallback**: Always keep Sheets functional as backup

#### **Interface Architecture:**
- **GM Interface**: Full campaign management (existing `/campaigns` and `/campaign/[id]`)
- **Trailblazer Interface**: Player-focused character sheet mirror (`/trailblazer`)
- **Dual-Mode**: Both interfaces can access same data with appropriate permissions

### **ðŸš¨ Emergency Protocols:**
- If database interface breaks â†’ Immediate fallback to Google Sheets
- If bugs affect live campaign â†’ Priority #1 immediate fix
- All features must have "safe mode" operation paths

## MCP Server Integration Protocol (Added 2025-09-13)

### Pre-Task MCP Server Setup
**ALWAYS run before starting any development task to gather current system state:**

```bash
# Initialize Growth Rules MCP Server
GROWTH_REPO="C:/Users/Mikek/Desktop/GROWTH/GROWTH_Repository" CAMPAIGN_REPO="C:/Users/Mikek/Desktop/GROWTH/Campaign_Data" node "mcp/growth-rules-mcp/dist/index.js"
```

```bash
# Initialize Campaign MCP Server
GROWTH_REPO="C:/Users/Mikek/Desktop/GROWTH/GROWTH_Repository" CAMPAIGN_REPO="C:/Users/Mikek/Desktop/GROWTH/Campaign_Data" node "mcp/campaign-mcp/dist/index.js"
```

### Post-Task MCP Server Operations
**ALWAYS run after completing any task to update the knowledge graph:**

```bash
# Update Growth Rules Knowledge Graph
GROWTH_REPO="C:/Users/Mikek/Desktop/GROWTH/GROWTH_Repository" CAMPAIGN_REPO="C:/Users/Mikek/Desktop/GROWTH/Campaign_Data" node "mcp/growth-rules-mcp/dist/index.js"
```

```bash
# Update Campaign Knowledge Graph
GROWTH_REPO="C:/Users/Mikek/Desktop/GROWTH/GROWTH_Repository" CAMPAIGN_REPO="C:/Users/Mikek/Desktop/GROWTH/Campaign_Data" node "mcp/campaign-mcp/dist/index.js"
```

### Available MCP Tools

#### Growth Rules MCP Server:
- `rulesOpenIssue` - Open new growth rule issues
- `rulesProposeChange` - Propose changes to growth rules
- `rulesApplyPatch` - Apply patches to growth rules

#### Campaign MCP Server:
- Campaign management and data analysis tools

### MCP Environment Variables:
- `GROWTH_REPO`: C:/Users/Mikek/Desktop/GROWTH/GROWTH_Repository
- `CAMPAIGN_REPO`: C:/Users/Mikek/Desktop/GROWTH/Campaign_Data

### MCP Workflow Integration:
1. **Pre-Task**: Connect to MCP servers to understand current state
2. **Task Execution**: Use appropriate MCP tools during implementation
3. **Post-Task**: Update knowledge graphs with changes made
4. **Validation**: Ensure all systems are synchronized

### MCP Build Commands:
```bash
# Build MCP servers before first use
pnpm --filter growth-rules-mcp build
pnpm --filter campaign-mcp build

# Development mode
pnpm --filter growth-rules-mcp run dev
```

## Port 3000 Management Solution (Fixed 2025-09-05)

### Problem Solved:
- **Issue**: Development server couldn't start on port 3000 consistently
- **Root Cause**: Persistent Node.js processes occupying port 3000
- **Impact**: Authentication broke (NEXTAUTH_URL needs localhost:3000), campaign creation failed

### Solution Implemented:

#### 1. Automated Cleanup Scripts Created:
- `scripts/cleanup-port.js` - Cross-platform port cleanup (Node.js)
- `scripts/cleanup-and-start.js` - One-command cleanup + server start
- `scripts/cleanup-port.bat` - Windows batch file backup

#### 2. Package.json Scripts Added:
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev:clean": "node scripts/cleanup-and-start.js",  // RECOMMENDED
    "cleanup": "node scripts/cleanup-port.js",
    "reset": "npm run cleanup && npm run dev"
  }
}
```

#### 3. Key Commands for Development:
- **Primary**: `pnpm dev:clean` - Always use this
- **Cleanup only**: `pnpm cleanup`
- **Manual**: `pnpm dev` (may fail if port busy)

#### 4. What the Scripts Do:
1. Kill all processes using port 3000
2. Kill stuck Next.js/Node processes  
3. Wait 3 seconds for cleanup
4. Double-check cleanup
5. Start server on port 3000

### Environment Requirements:
- `NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000` (CRITICAL)
- Server MUST run on port 3000 for auth to work
- Database sessions configured with Prisma adapter

### Dependencies Added:
- `@next-auth/prisma-adapter` - For database sessions
- `@prisma/client` - Database client
- `prisma` - Database toolkit
- `googleapis` - Google API integration

### Authentication Fix:
- Changed from JWT to database sessions
- Added Prisma adapter to NextAuth config
- Fixed session callback for user ID

### Files Created:
- `/scripts/cleanup-port.js` - Main cleanup logic
- `/scripts/cleanup-and-start.js` - Development starter
- `/scripts/cleanup-port.bat` - Windows batch backup
- `/DEV_GUIDE.md` - Development documentation

### Test Results:
âœ… Port 3000 cleanup working  
âœ… Server starts on port 3000  
âœ… HTTP 200 response confirmed  
âœ… Authentication properly configured  
âœ… Campaign creation should work  

### Future Usage:
**ALWAYS run:** `pnpm dev:clean` to start development

This ensures:
- Port 3000 is always available
- No authentication issues
- Campaign creation works
- Easy restart/reset capability

### Troubleshooting Commands:
If issues persist:
```bash
pnpm cleanup          # Just cleanup
netstat -ano | findstr :3000   # Check port usage
pnpm dev:clean        # Full reset and start
```

## Authentication "OAuthAccountNotLinked" Error - PERMANENT SOLUTION (Fixed 2025-09-07)

### Problem Pattern:
This error occurs repeatedly due to **cached browser authentication state** from failed attempts.

### Root Causes:
1. **Orphaned user records** - User exists but no linked OAuth account
2. **Cached browser sessions** - Browser reuses failed authentication state
3. **Out-of-sync Prisma client** - Schema changes not reflected in generated client

### PROVEN Solution (Use this exact sequence):
```bash
# 1. Stop all dev servers
pnpm cleanup

# 2. Regenerate Prisma client  
pnpm prisma generate

# 3. Clean orphaned user data
node -e "
const { PrismaClient } = require('@prisma/client');
const prisma = new PrismaClient();
(async () => {
  const users = await prisma.user.findMany({ include: { accounts: true } });
  for (const user of users) {
    if (user.accounts.length === 0) {
      await prisma.user.delete({ where: { id: user.id } });
      console.log('Deleted orphaned user:', user.email);
    }
  }
  await prisma.\$disconnect();
})();
"

# 4. Start fresh server
pnpm dev:clean
```

### CRITICAL: User must clear browser cache
- **Best**: Open incognito/private window
- **Alt**: Clear localhost:3000 cookies: next-auth.state, next-auth.pkce.code_verifier

### Signs of Success:
âœ… New state values in logs (not cached ones)  
âœ… adapter_createUser and adapter_linkAccount logs appear  
âœ… Successful redirect to homepage  

**This pattern has occurred multiple times - always use this solution.**

## Previous Issues Fixed:
- Missing Prisma dependencies
- JWT vs database session configuration  
- Port conflicts preventing server startup
- Authentication configuration for Google OAuth
- OAuthAccountNotLinked error (multiple occurrences)

## Commands for Future Reference:
- Development: `pnpm dev:clean`
- Database: `pnpm prisma generate`, `pnpm prisma migrate dev`
- Cleanup: `pnpm cleanup`
- Reset: `pnpm reset`

## Session 2025-09-13: Manual Invite System & Cloudflare Tunnel Deployment

### Summary:
Successfully transitioned from Gmail API email sending to a manual invite link system with Cloudflare tunnel for public access. Resolved OAuth sensitive scope issues and created a robust testing environment.

### Problem Solved:
**Issue**: Gmail API required sensitive OAuth scopes and Google verification, blocking email functionality
**Root Cause**: Google's restrictions on sensitive scopes (gmail.send, spreadsheets) in testing mode
**Impact**: Could not send invitation emails to testers, blocking user onboarding

### Solution Implemented:

#### 1. Manual Invite Link System:
- Removed Gmail API dependencies completely
- Created copyable invite link UI with one-click copy functionality
- Added success modal showing manual share instructions
- Links automatically use proper production domain

#### 2. Cloudflare Tunnel for Public Access:
- Installed and configured cloudflared tunnel
- Public URL: `https://toys-tb-actress-metropolitan.trycloudflare.com`
- HTTPS access from anywhere in the world
- No port forwarding or firewall configuration needed

#### 3. OAuth Scope Simplification:
- Removed sensitive scopes: `gmail.send`, `spreadsheets`
- Kept only: `openid`, `email`, `profile`, `drive.file`
- No Google verification required for non-sensitive scopes
- Updated Google Cloud Console with Cloudflare tunnel URLs

#### 4. Security Enhancements:
- Restricted invitations to `mikekan13@gmail.com` only during testing
- Added proper error messages for unauthorized invite attempts
- Invite links expire in 7 days automatically

### Files Modified:
- `src/app/api/players/invite/route.ts` - Removed Gmail API, added manual link system
- `src/app/campaigns/page.tsx` - Added copyable invite link UI with success modal
- `src/lib/auth.ts` - Simplified OAuth scopes to non-sensitive only
- `.env` - Updated NEXTAUTH_URL to Cloudflare tunnel domain

### Technical Infrastructure:
- **Local Server**: `localhost:3000` (development)
- **Public Access**: `https://toys-tb-actress-metropolitan.trycloudflare.com`
- **OAuth Configuration**: Updated for Cloudflare domain
- **Invite System**: Manual link sharing via UI copy functionality

### Testing Results:
âœ… Cloudflare tunnel working - public HTTPS access
âœ… OAuth authentication working with simplified scopes
âœ… Manual invite link generation working
âœ… Copy-to-clipboard functionality working
âœ… Invite links properly formatted with tunnel domain
âœ… Only authorized user can create invitations
âœ… Testers can access and sign in successfully

### Current Status:
- **Ready for Testing**: Testers can access via public Cloudflare URL
- **Invite System Working**: Manual links generated and copyable
- **Security Implemented**: Only mikekan13@gmail.com can create invites
- **Public Access**: Available worldwide via HTTPS

### Known Issue for Next Session:
**Player Interface**: Invited players currently see GM interface after signup
- Need separate GM vs Player dashboards
- Players should see player-specific functionality only
- Current system auto-promotes all users to GM role

### Cloudflare Tunnel Commands:
```bash
# Install (already done)
npm install -g cloudflared

# Start tunnel (run when needed)
cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:3000
# Generates: https://toys-tb-actress-metropolitan.trycloudflare.com
```

### Environment Configuration:
```bash
NEXTAUTH_URL=https://toys-tb-actress-metropolitan.trycloudflare.com
```
