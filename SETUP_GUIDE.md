# GROWTH Prototype Setup Guide

Complete step-by-step instructions for setting up the GROWTH Prototype application.

## üìã What You're Setting Up

GROWTH Prototype is a campaign management web application for the GROWTH tabletop RPG system that runs entirely on your local machine. It provides:

- Campaign creation and management
- Character system with backstories
- World building with KRMA investment
- Player invitation and management
- GM tools and dashboards
- KRMA tokenomics system

## üéØ Prerequisites

### Required Software
- **Node.js 20 or higher** - [Download here](https://nodejs.org/)
- **pnpm** - Fast package manager (installed via npm)
- **Git** (optional) - For version control

### System Requirements
- **OS**: Windows, macOS, or Linux
- **RAM**: 4GB minimum
- **Disk**: 500MB free space

## üöÄ Installation Steps

### Step 1: Install Node.js

1. Go to https://nodejs.org/
2. Download the LTS (Long Term Support) version
3. Run the installer and follow the prompts
4. Verify installation by opening a terminal/command prompt and running:
   ```bash
   node --version
   ```
   You should see something like `v20.x.x`

### Step 2: Install pnpm

pnpm is a faster alternative to npm. Install it globally:

```bash
npm install -g pnpm
```

Verify installation:
```bash
pnpm --version
```

### Step 3: Navigate to the Project

Open a terminal/command prompt and navigate to the growth-prototype folder:

**Windows:**
```bash
cd "C:\Users\YourUsername\Desktop\GROWTH\GROWTH Prototype\growth-prototype"
```

**Mac/Linux:**
```bash
cd ~/Desktop/GROWTH/GROWTH\ Prototype/growth-prototype
```

### Step 4: Install Dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

This will download and install all required packages. It may take 2-5 minutes.

### Step 5: Set Up the Database

The app uses SQLite, which requires no separate installation. Initialize the database:

```bash
npx prisma generate
npx prisma migrate dev
```

This creates the database file at `prisma/dev.db`.

### Step 6: (Optional) Seed Test Data

To populate the database with test data:

```bash
pnpm seed
```

This creates:
- Test admin user
- Sample campaigns
- Example characters
- Reserve KRMA wallets

### Step 7: Start the Application

```bash
pnpm dev:clean
```

You should see output like:
```
‚úì Ready in 2.8s
- Local: http://localhost:3000
```

**Important**: Keep this terminal window open while using the app!

### Step 8: Access the Application

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Port 3000 Already in Use

If you see an error about port 3000 being busy, the `dev:clean` command should handle it automatically. If not:

```bash
# Just cleanup
pnpm cleanup

# Then start again
pnpm dev
```

### Database Errors

If you see database-related errors:

```bash
# Regenerate Prisma client
npx prisma generate

# Reset database (WARNING: deletes all data)
npx prisma migrate reset

# Apply migrations
npx prisma migrate dev
```

### "Module not found" Errors

If you see missing module errors:

```bash
# Clean install
rm -rf node_modules
pnpm install
npx prisma generate
```

### Application Won't Start

1. Make sure Node.js 20+ is installed: `node --version`
2. Make sure pnpm is installed: `pnpm --version`
3. Try deleting `node_modules` and reinstalling:
   ```bash
   rm -rf node_modules
   pnpm install
   ```

### Can't Register or Login

1. Check that the database exists: `ls prisma/dev.db`
2. If not, run: `npx prisma migrate dev`
3. Clear browser cache and try again
4. Check terminal for error messages

## üí° Tips for Development

### Viewing the Database

Use Prisma Studio to view and edit database records:

```bash
npx prisma studio
```

This opens a web interface at http://localhost:5555

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pnpm test

# Run tests with UI
pnpm test:ui

# View test report
pnpm test:report
```

### Stopping the Server

Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal where the server is running.

### Restarting After Changes

Most code changes auto-reload. For database schema changes:

```bash
# Stop server (Ctrl+C)
npx prisma generate
npx prisma migrate dev
pnpm dev:clean
```

## üìÅ Important Files

## Advanced Topics

### Using MCP Servers (Optional)

The project includes optional MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers for AI assistance. See the main README for setup instructions.

### Custom Port Configuration

If you need to run on a different port:

1. Edit `package.json` scripts
2. Update any hardcoded port references
3. Note: Authentication is configured for port 3000 by default

### Production Deployment

For production use:

```bash
pnpm build
pnpm start
```

This runs an optimized production build.
