## Step 2: Configure the GROWTH Prototype

### 2.1 Open the Configuration File

1. **Open File Explorer** (Windows key + E)
2. **Navigate to:** `C:\Users\[YourName]\Desktop\GROWTH\GROWTH Prototype\growth-prototype`
3. **Find the file** named `.env`
4. **Right-click** on `.env` and select **"Open with" > "Notepad"**

### 2.2 Update the Configuration

You'll see a file that looks like this:
```
# Database
DATABASE_URL="file:./dev.db"

# Google OAuth (fill in your values)
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=__FILL_ME__
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=__FILL_ME__

# NextAuth
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=__make_something_random__

# Session
SESSION_SECRET=__make_something_random__

# GROWTH Repository Path
GROWTH_REPO_PATH=C:\Users\Mikek\Desktop\GROWTH\GROWTH_Repository

# Obsidian Vault Path  
OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH=./apps/GROWTH_Vault
```

**Make these changes:**

1. **Replace** `__FILL_ME__` next to `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=` with your Client ID from Step 1.4
   ```
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=123456789-abcdef.apps.googleusercontent.com
   ```

2. **Replace** `__FILL_ME__` next to `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=` with your Client Secret from Step 1.4
   ```
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=GOCSPX-abcd1234efgh5678
   ```

3. **Replace** both `__make_something_random__` entries with random passwords you create:
   ```
   NEXTAUTH_SECRET=MyRandomPassword123!
   SESSION_SECRET=AnotherRandomPassword456@
   ```
   *Note: These can be any passwords you want - they're just for security*

4. **Update the GROWTH_REPO_PATH** if needed. Change `Mikek` to your Windows username:
   ```
   GROWTH_REPO_PATH=C:\Users\[YourUsername]\Desktop\GROWTH\GROWTH_Repository
   ```

5. **Save the file** (Ctrl+S) and close Notepad

### 2.3 Example of Completed Configuration

Your `.env` file should look something like this:
```
# Database
DATABASE_URL="file:./dev.db"

# Google OAuth (fill in your values)
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=123456789-abcdefghijklmnop.apps.googleusercontent.com
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=GOCSPX-abcd1234efgh5678ijklmnop

# NextAuth
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=MyRandomPassword123!

# Session
SESSION_SECRET=AnotherRandomPassword456@

# GROWTH Repository Path
GROWTH_REPO_PATH=C:\Users\YourUsername\Desktop\GROWTH\GROWTH_Repository

# Obsidian Vault Path  
OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH=./apps/GROWTH_Vault
```

## ðŸš¨ Troubleshooting

### Problem: "Command not found" when typing `pnpm dev`

**Solution:** You need to install pnpm first
1. **In Command Prompt, type:** `npm install -g pnpm`
2. **Press Enter** and wait for it to install
3. **Try `pnpm dev` again**

### Problem: Browser shows "This site can't be reached"

**Solutions:**
1. **Make sure the Command Prompt** is still running (you should see it running in the background)
2. **Check the URL** - it should be exactly `http://localhost:3000`
3. **Try** `http://127.0.0.1:3000` instead

### Problem: Google OAuth errors

**Solutions:**
1. **Double-check your `.env` file** - make sure there are no extra spaces
2. **Make sure your Google Cloud project** has both APIs enabled (Drive + Sheets)
3. **Try creating new OAuth credentials** and updating your `.env` file

### Problem: "Can't access your sheets"

**Solutions:**
1. **Make sure your sheets are shared** with your Google account
2. **Try copying the sheet ID** instead of the full URL (the part between `/d/` and `/edit`)
3. **Check that your Google account** has permission to view the sheets

## ðŸ“ž Getting Help

If you run into problems:

1. **Check the Command Prompt window** for error messages
2. **Make sure all steps were followed exactly**
3. **Try refreshing your browser** at http://localhost:3000
4. **Restart the application** by pressing Ctrl+C in Command Prompt, then typing `pnpm dev` again

## ðŸŽ‰ You're Ready to Play!

Once everything is set up, you can:

- âœ… **Manage multiple campaigns**
- âœ… **Import character sheets from Google Sheets**
- âœ… **View parsed character data**
- âœ… **Handle unknown fields through the Decision Queue**
- âœ… **Track game sessions**
