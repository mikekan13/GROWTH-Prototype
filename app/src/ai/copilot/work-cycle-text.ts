/**
 * The prompt text one DAYA work cycle hands JEWL (work-loop.ts). Pure.
 *
 * It carries the session's plan verbatim — for a character genesis that is
 * the whole backstory (character-genesis-plan.ts). The text is dispatched as
 * source JEWL_WORK_CYCLE, class FICTION (content-class.ts), so on a cloud
 * lane it crosses only through route() → toneFilter → assertNoTableContent.
