# ✅ GROWTH MCP Integration - SUCCESS!

## Working Setup

The GROWTH prototype now has a fully functional "brain" system using Claude Desktop + MCP!

### What's Working:

✅ **Issue Logging**: `log_issue` tool writes to `GROWTH_Repository/corrections/issues.jsonl`
✅ **Event Logging**: `log_event` tool writes to `Campaign_Data/events.jsonl`  
✅ **NPC Management**: `create_npc` tool manages NPCs in `Campaign_Data/npcs/`

### Current Architecture:

```
Claude Desktop 
    ↓ (MCP Protocol)
Python MCP Server (growth_mcp_server.py)
    ↓ (File Operations)
GROWTH_Repository/ & Campaign_Data/
```

### Available Tools in Claude:

1. **`log_issue`** - Log rule problems/bugs
   - Creates timestamped entries in `corrections/issues.jsonl`
   - Perfect for tracking gameplay issues that need fixing

2. **`log_event`** - Log campaign events
   - Records all campaign activities in `events.jsonl`
   - Tracks actors, summaries, and references

3. **`create_npc`** - Manage NPCs
   - Creates/updates NPC files in `npcs/` directory
   - Merges data for existing NPCs

### Configuration:

**Claude Config**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "growth-mcp": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["C:/Users/Mikek/Desktop/GROWTH/GROWTH Prototype/mcp/growth_mcp_server.py"],
      "env": {
        "GROWTH_REPO": "C:/Users/Mikek/Desktop/GROWTH/GROWTH_Repository",
        "CAMPAIGN_REPO": "C:/Users/Mikek/Desktop/GROWTH/Campaign_Data"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Usage Examples:

**Log a rule issue:**
```
Can you log an issue about combat timing being unclear in the rules?
```

**Log a campaign event:**
```
Please log that the party entered the Dragon's Lair tavern and met Gareth the Barkeeper.
```

**Create an NPC:**
```
Create an NPC named Elara Moonwhisper, a mysterious elf merchant first seen at the crossroads market.
```

### Next Steps:

This foundation can be extended with:
- Rule proposal system
- Automated rule patching
- Character sheet integration
- Real-time campaign state management
- Integration with other AI systems

The "brain" is now ready to intelligently manage your GROWTH prototype!
